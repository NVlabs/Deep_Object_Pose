NVIDIA's [Isaac ROS2](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/index.html) project provides a collection of hardware-accelerated, ROS 2 packages, including one for [DOPE](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_pose_estimation/index.html).

This code is for inference only, so [training a custom model](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/concepts/pose_estimation/dope/tutorial_custom_model.html) should be done with the code in this repository.
